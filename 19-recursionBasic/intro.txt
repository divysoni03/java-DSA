-> recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on to smaller instances 
        of the same problem.

-> simply when the function calls itself that's called 'recursion'.
    
    - mainly used in Trees, graphs, Dynamic programming

- there is one base case in the recursion which defines the stop point of the recursion which is very important to
    stop calling, unless it will be infinite calling.
