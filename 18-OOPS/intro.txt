// Object - entities in real world (actual implementation)
// Class -  group of this entities (defines blueprint of object)

// example code :
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pen p1 = new Pen();
        p1.setColor("blue");
        p1.setPrice(15.0f);

        System.out.println(p1.color);
        System.out.println(p1.price);
    }
}

class Pen {
    String color;
    float price;

    void setColor(String c) {
        color = c;
    }
    void setPrice(float p) {
        price = p;
    }
}

// Access modifiers :
private, public, default, protected

//Getter & Setters
Getter - to return a value
Setter - to set some value

this - this keyword is used to refer to the current object


// Encapsulation - defined as wrapping up of data & methods under a single unit. it also implements data hiding.
    -> simply using access modifiers

// constructor, parametrized constructor, copy constructor

// shallow & deep copy & lazy copy

. basic things (skipped)
.
.

//abstract class - 
    - can't create an instance of an abstract class (can't not create objects)
    - can have abstract and non abstract methods
    - can have constructors


Note - in any multilevel, inheritance the parents constructor is called first
 ex., animal -> horse -> mustang , then if we make object of mustang then animal will be called first and then the horse and then the mustang



//interfaces - is the blueprint of the class
    used for :
        -achieve multiple inheritance
        -achieve total abstraction
        
defined with 'interface' keyword
    properties : 
        -all methods are public, abstract & without implementation
        -used to achieve total abstraction
        -variables in interface are final, public and static
        -to inherit a interface to a class we use 'implements' keyword, to inherit to another interface we use 'extends' keyword

//static keyword - used to share the same variable or method of a given class 
    used on : 
        -properties
        -functions
        -blocks
        -nested classes

//super keyword - used to refer immediate parent class object 
    -to access parent's properties
    -to access parent's functions
    -to access parent's constructors



NOTE : in java no class can be private and protected, if we do then the class will become unusable
